# maze-shooter

This is a first-person shooter game in 3D.
Players can move with ```WASD``` control, jump with ```space```, and fire projectiles with ```F``` key.
The view camera is controlled by mouse input.
The terrain consists of 3 parts: a starting area, a destination area, and a dynamically generated maze connecting the two areas.
Maze generation is implemented based on [Eller's algorithm](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/29/maze-generation-eller-s-algorithm).
More detailed game design can be found [here](https://frankzhang427.github.io/pdf/maze_shooter.pdf).
